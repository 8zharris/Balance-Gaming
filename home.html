        <h2>About us</h2>
        
            <p>Balance Gaming was founded by Seiga Ikemura and Zacky Harris in 2019. Their career started when they first met in the Year 10 Advanced I.T class of
            Hamilton Boys’ High School. 
            The duo mainly focused on creating games 
            for young teens using a game development program called Scratch. We use this less sophisticated/simple programing language as a 
            way to show young coders that they are able to make games just like us! 
            <br>
            <p>Balance Gaming always go the extra mile to ensure entertain for our consumers and fans. 
                Without our fans, we wouldn’t be able to pursue game development. We work hard to create fun and engaging experiences in our games and reward our players on each level.</p>
            <p>The passion of our craft is what brings out development team together. Together with our development group we achieve goals that no one individual would be able to achieve alone.</p>
